# Go Concurrency Patterns

This skill provides a comprehensive overview of concurrency in Go programming. It covers goroutines, channels, and the standard library (stdlib), including how to effectively manage concurrent tasks in your Go applications.

## TL;DR Checklist
- [ ] Understand what goroutines are and how to create them.
- [ ] Implement channels to communicate between goroutines.
- [ ] Learn about Go's module system to manage dependencies.
- [ ] Use the standard library effectively for concurrency.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- You need to execute multiple tasks simultaneously in your Go application.
- You're unsure how to utilize channels for safe communication between goroutines.
- You require guidance on managing dependencies using Go modules.

---

## When NOT to Use

Avoid this skill for:
- Simple sequential programming tasks where concurrency is unnecessary.
- Codebases that do not implement Go or require different concurrency paradigms (e.g., Rust, Java).

---

## Core Workflow

1. **Create a Goroutine**  
   Use the `go` keyword to start a function as a goroutine. A goroutine runs concurrently but in the same address space.
   - **Checkpoint:** Ensure the main function runs longer than the goroutines to see their effects.

2. **Implement Channels**  
   Use channels to communicate between goroutines for data exchange. Channels can be buffered or unbuffered.
   - **Checkpoint:** Validate that data sent through channels is received by the intended goroutines.

3. **Explore the Standard Library**  
   Leverage Go’s standard library functions relevant to concurrency, such as `sync` for wait groups and mutexes.
   - **Checkpoint:** Ensure libraries are imported correctly in your Go module.

4. **Utilize Go Modules**  
   Manage your project dependencies using Go modules to ensure reproducible builds.
   - **Checkpoint:** Confirm that your `go.mod` file includes the necessary dependencies.

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Using Goroutines

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func hello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from goroutine")
}

func main() {
    go hello()  // Starts a new goroutine
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)  // Wait for goroutine to finish
    fmt.Println("Main function finished")
}
```

### Pattern 2: Communication using Channels

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func worker(ch chan string) {
    msg := "Message from worker"
    ch <- msg  // Send message to channel
}

func main() {
    ch := make(chan string)
    go worker(ch)  // Start worker as goroutine
    msg := <-ch  // Receive message from channel
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

---

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Always ensure synchronization while accessing shared data to avoid race conditions.
- Utilize buffered channels where appropriate to avoid blocking on send operations.

### MUST NOT DO
- Avoid using global variables without proper locking mechanisms as it can lead to inconsistent states and data races.
- Do not block the main function execution without reason; use wait groups if multiple goroutines are running.
